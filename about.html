                <p class="about">Wooded Wonderland was created in 2020; my senior year of college. My mom had used Sola flowers for several of her home decor projects, and I wanted to use these flowers for my wedding. I saw these flowers as an opportunity to express my relationship's personality, and show a unique option for wedding floral arrangements in Montana. Thanks to a 'Shark Tank' style program at my college, I received funding to begin my business venture, and here we are!</p>

                    <p class="aboutwoodflowers">All of our flowers are handmade from sola (or shola) wood, which is a woody shrub that grows in tropical regions around the world. Each flower is made by women who live in these areas, mainly India and Thailand. Using wood flowers not only creates a beautiful keepsake for you, but also provides jobs with fair wages and safe working conditions for women in these areas.</p>

                    <p class="aboutwoodflowers">These flowers are actually soft to the touch, flexible, and have a very similar look to real flowers. In their natural colors they are ivory and brown (fron the outside bark.) Some have light wood grain and brown flecks, giving your flowers a beautiful and rustic look. Because of variations in wood grain and being made by hand, every flower is truly unique in shape and size, just like real flowers.</p>

                    <p class="aboutwoodflowers">With dozens of flower designs, brides can easily incorporate their favorite blooms, regardless of the season. Almost any flower can be created with sola wood!</p>
