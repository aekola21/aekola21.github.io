                <h1><a href="http://balloons-n-flowers.com"> A Bad Website: Forget Me Not Flowers</a></h1>

                <p>This website is...well...rough. It could probably be put on website that you brought up in class of 'The World's Worst Websites'. What is really sad is that this is a local flower shop. It makes me want to ask them if they need help with their website. Anyway, back to the task at hand. As you can probably tell, there are MANY different parts of this website that I do not like at all. First of all, the homepage background, section background, section image, and footer colors really clash. They have 2 shades of green with a white footer an a really bright blue image. On top of that, the blue flower image is slightly off center on the page and is smaller than the light green section color, so you can see the light green color on the left and bottom of the blue flower image background. Another issue is that all of the information provided on the home page is put into boxes that have different colored backgrounds with different fonts, colors, borders, etc. Throughout the site, there are different font headings, colors, and sizes which makes the site look even more unprofessional. An issue that I discovered on the 'Corsages & Boutonnieres' page is that two of the image galleries are put next to eachother. Not only does this make it hard to navigate the page, but the images for 'Wrislets' don't even show up. The site is also not mobile or small screen user friendly, which is a huge disadvantage for any website these days.</p>

                <p>All in all, the best way to explain the issue with this website is that the website layout and aesthecis are a distraction from the information and images. </p>

                <h1><a href="http://theflower.bar"> A Good Website: The Flower Bar</a></h1>

                <p>The Flower Bar has a very pleasing website. One characteristic that I really like about this site is the use of color. The peachy-rose color is very pleasing, and she using it well with her white space. Another part of this site that I like is the fact that it is easily navigatable from both a desktop and a mobile device. Something else that really appeals to me is the fact that on the home page there is a big photo gallery that changes every few seconds. If you notice, there is no navigation bar when you are viewing this gallery except on the left hand side of the side symbolized by the three horizonal lines. If you scrolll down to the next section of information, an almost-navigation bar appears and remains at the top of the page as you continue to scroll. Instead of it being a typical navigation bar, the bar that appears has the company's logo, and then the menu button remains in the top left corner so the user can get to the navigation bar. Speaking of pictures, near the bottom of the home page there are several large images with buttons in the middle of them. If you hover over the image, a nice transparent box with a border appears. I really like this because the box isn't tacky and it also lets your user know what they are clicking on. After exploring the site (and me being the engaged person that I am), I stumbled onto the 'Wedding' tab. I really enjoyed this page as well. I like how the page has a sort of compare and contrast with the explanations into two different colored boxes. Then, after the boxes, is a form that is really simple but professional. </p>

                <p>Overall, I am really drawn to the unique colors and layout of the website. I think that it is professional but also fun.</p>

                <h1><a href="http://elements-of-light-mt.com"> A Good Website: Elements of Light Photography</a></h1>

                <p>The final website that I am going to review is actually my wedding photographer. Susan Beth (the owner) has done a fabulous job with her website. I really enjoy her use of white space, and I think that her use of it really matches with her job and her audience. As a wedding and boudoir photographer, white is a common color found in her images, and I think that by using it she appeals to her entire audience. Something else that is really interesting about her website is that all of her images are linked to Pinterest, so a user can click on the Pinterest button that appears when hovering over an image and save it to their Pinterest. Her navigation is also super unique because instead of being in a banner, it is in the image at the top of each page besides the 'About Me' page and the 'Portfolio' page. I think that this is a super unique and interesting way to design her navigation. Her website is also relatively user friendly on a mobile or small screen. There are a few issues with social media buttons overlaying some of the navigation buttons, but overall everything is till navigatable. </p>

                <p>This page is just so clean and unique compared to a lot of sites that I have been on. The most prominent aspect of this site that I really like is the fact that the images can all be saved to Pinterest. This really makes this site user friendly and is really speaking to the typical users of this site.</p>
