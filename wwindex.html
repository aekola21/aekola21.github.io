                <h2 class="homeconsult">Consultation & Design Board</h2>

                <p class="homesection2para">You request a consultation, we set up a time to connect in person or virtually if you are far away. At that time we will get to know each other, answer questions, and set up a wedding floral package that meets you heart's desire.</p>

                <h2>Arrangement Creation</h2>

                <p class="homepara">Throughout the time between your initial consultation and your wedding day we will stay in contact. As I put together your arrangements I will send you pictures of the product. If there is anything that you want changed, I will make those changes and then send you more pictures until you are completely happy with the arrangements.</p>

                <h2>Delivery!</h2>

                <p class="homepara">You can expect your arrangments to be sent (or deliverd if you're local) a month prior to your wedding day. We do this for several reasons. One reason is to lessen the stress on you as the bride and/or your day-of coordinator. Because these arrangements do not wilth or die, we can send them to you much earlier than the day of your wedding. Then, if any changes need to be made, there is still enough time to make those changes without a rush (or a huge rush fee). </p>
