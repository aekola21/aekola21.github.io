                <p>Many parts of the world have four seasons in a year. They are spring, summer, autumn, and winter. The weather is different during each season. As the weather changes, plants change, and animals change their behavior to suit the weather. In spring, the weather begins to get warmer and trees and other plants grow new leaves. Summer is the hottest season and has long, usually sunny, days. In the autumn, the weather becomes mild and leaves start falling from many types of trees. Winter is the coldest season with short days. Many trees are bare and some animals enter into a deep sleep called hibernation. They do this to save energy until spring, when it will be easier to find food. </p>
