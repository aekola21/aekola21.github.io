                <p>Spring is the season when the landscape comes to life after a cold winter. There is stronger sunlight, temperatures begin to rise, and the days grow longer. The weather can change a lot in the spring. It can be sunny and dry one minute, and wet and rainy the next. Blossoms appears on some trees and many low-growing plants burst into flower. Animals that have been hidden away in a deep sleep called hibernation wake up and come out from their dens. Many birds and animals return from their winter homes and start to breed. In the northern hemisphere, Earth's upper half, spring begins in March. In the southern hemisphere, Earth's lower half, spring begins in September.</p>
