                <p>Autumn is a season during which the days get shorter and temperatures start to drop. In some places, rainfall increases. In areas with icy winters, some trees, such as oak, sycamore, and birch, prepare to lose their leaves. These trees are called deciduous trees. They stop producing chlorophyll, which is a chemical that helps plants make food from sunlight and also gives leaves their green color. As chlorophyll gradually disappears from the leaves, they turn to shades of red, orange, yellow, and brown. Many plants make seeds that will become new plants in the spring. Some animals grow thicker fur to get ready for the cold winter. Others gain weight to prepare for a deep sleep called hibernation to take them through winter. In the northern hemisphere, Earth's upper half, fall takes placed from September to December, and in the southern hemisphere, Earth's lower half, it is from March to June.</p>
