    <h1>Ary's Rockin' Awesome Review of State Websites</h1>
    <p>Below you will find my ranking of 5 different state websites along with an explanation as to why I like or dislike the website.</p>

    <ol>
        <li><a href="https://www.alabama.gov">Alabama</a></li>
        <p>This website is my #1 draft pick. First, let me discuss the color and overall layout. I really like how the website's background/base color is white with banners and boxes of deep blue. This is very pleasing and professional. In terms of the layout, the website spans the size of the monitor/screen; it is not inset like other state websites that I will write about later. The website is also easy to navigate both on mobile and desktop screens, and it is not cluttered with loads of information. Everything is neatly put in a box (literally and figuratively) and linked. Another ascpect of this website that I really like is the fact that the search bar is big and the first thing that you come to in terms of content, but it is not the only thing on your screen when you load the site on a desktop monitor. You are able to see other resources and information which makes the website seem much more balanced and proportional. One thing that I do not like about the State of Alabama website is that when you click on one of their links, you are redirected to that link in the same tab instead of the link opening in a new tab. The initial webpage also provides various resources/links for people to easily find what they are looking for, but there is not an overabundance of these resources/links.</p>
        <li><a href="https://www.mass.gov">Massachusetts</a></li>
        <p>Coming in at #2 is the website for the state of Massachusetts. The Massachusetts website had many similarities to the Alabama website, however, there were some characteristics of the website that made it fall to #2. Right when you get on to this website, a beautiful picture of the state capital is shown. However, this is where Massachusetts falls short. The image and text on the image are not all seen when you first open the page. You have to scroll down some to see the rest of the image and information, which is something that did not look asthetically pleasing to me. The color of the page is mostly white with hints of blue, which is very similar to the Alabama website. Other than these issues, the layout of the page is very clean, uncluttered, professional, and spans the length of the entire screen. The Massachusetts site is easily navigatable from both mobile and desktop screens, and it provides links to outside resources. Another similarity to Alabama's website, which is something that I do not like about any website, is the fact that when you click on a link, you are redirected to that link in the same tab instead of the link opening in a new tab. Another characteristic of the Massachusetts website is the fact that there are not as many resources/links available. Unlike the Alabama page, this page has very few resources immediately available for people to find. Therefore, people are having to do more searching on the website which takes away the convenience of it. </p>
        <li><a href="https://www.mn.gov">Minnesota</a></li>
        <p>Third place in this state website review is Minnesota. Similar to the previous websites, this site has a large image representing the state with a search bar for easy searching. Again, the color scheme of this page is blue and white, however, blue is the main color of the page with white accents. Though this is just personal taste, I really like clean, white websites with hints of color. This is one reason why this website is ranked below the Massachusetts site. Another issue with this website is the fact that there is even less information provided on the main page for people to navigate it than either of the websites already reviewed. The website is easily navigatable from both mobile and desktop screens, however, when this website is shurnk, you only see one piece of information at a time. For example, we start on the search bar, then the governor's office, corona virus information, etc. In a regular desktop screen, all of this information is side by side, making the webpage shorter and more navigatable. However, when we change over to a smaller window or a mobile screen, these sections and their images get larger, making the page longer and less user friendly. One thing that this page has that the others don't is that the links redirect you to another tab instead of staying in the same tab. </p>
        <li><a href="https://www.nh.gov">New Hampshire</a></li>
        <p>New Hampshire is taking the #4 spot. The main reason that this site is coming in so low is because it is inset on the page. Alabama, Massachusetts, and Minnesota's sites all spanned the width of the screen, but New Hampshire's site does not. In today's day and age, I think it is important to have your page span the width of the screen simply because it looks much more professional. Speaking of the professional look, that is one characteristic that this page is seriously lacking. I am guessing that by the end of this class I would be able to make a website that looks similar to this. As a state government website, it should be professional and informational. There is not a lot of information presented on the first page, which impacts how easy the site is to use. Though I have mentioned the importance of information on a page, there is a happy medium. Alabama and Massachusetts probably had the best balance out of the five sites reviewed here, and Alaska, who will be reviewed next, has an overabundance of information. In terms of ease of use accross mutiple devices, the New Hampshire website also falls short here. When looking at the site on a mobile device or on a readjusted monitor, the content does not change to fit the screen. Instead, the content size and placement remains the same, which causes the user on a mobile device to have to scroll side-to-side to see all of the content. Another issue with this website is the color scheme. Just like the other websites, white and blue are the colors used. However, this page used white and several different shades of blue. Instead of creating a complimentary color scheme, there are just different shades of the same color. Again, this is another example of how non-professional this page is. Finally, the links provided on the webpage do not redirect to a new tab. Instead, they open on the same page.</p>
        <li><a href="https://www.alaska.gov">Alaska</a></li>
        <p>And rounding out this website review is the state of Alaska. This website is just no bueno. Similar to New Hampshire, the site is inset insead of spanning the width of the screen. Another issue with this site is the fact that it is not mobile or small screen savy. This means that when looking at the site on a mobile or small screen, instead of the site formatting to the size of the screen, the site remains the same. So when you go to look at the site on these smaller screens, you have to scroll over to see all of the content. The buttons on the website are also a characteristic that is less than desireable. Instead of changing to a different shade of the button color or changing to a complimentary color, the color changes from blue to red when you hover over an item. This is honestly just really tacky and looks very bad. Another issue with the site is the amount of information provided on the main page. Though it is important for a government site to have accessible information, there is such a thing as information and link overload. Alaska has information and link overload on their page, with very little organization to it, so, again, their page looks very tacky and unprofessional. Just like most of the other sites that I have reviewed, the issue of links opening in the same tab arises. Instead of opening a new tab when clicking on a link, the link redirects you in the same tab which is just really frustrating. </p>
